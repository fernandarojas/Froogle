# Froogle
## Froogle is an interactive search engine that compares prices from: Ebay and Walmart
        * Think about what you want to compare, search, and in seconds you will have a price comparision.
        * Froogle will eliminate the time and hassle of searching between websites.
        * The website will also make your decision easier on wheater you want a used or new product. (It is a huge price gap or not?)
## Froogle's future
         * Ebay vs Walmart is our "showcase" for the bigger picture.
         * In the future Froogle could be used to compare other big merchants, websites, even coding languages, and more!
         * We also want to provide filters in the near future to make a more positive user expirence.
