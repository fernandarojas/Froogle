# Froogle

## Froogle is an interactive search engine that compares prices from: Ebay and Walmart 
* Think about what you want to compare, search, and in seconds you will have a price comparision 
* Froogle will eliminate the time and hassle of searching between websites.
* The website will also make your decision easier on wheater you want a used or new product. (It is a huge price gap or not?)
## Froogle's future
* Ebay vs Walmart is our "showcase" for the bigger picture.
* In the future Froogle could be used to compare other big merchants, websites, even coding languages, and more! 
* We also want to provide filters in the near future to make a more positive user expirence.
